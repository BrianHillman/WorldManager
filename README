World Manager is an Open Source world management tool for Unity3D virtual spaces.

It consists of a proxy for handling requests from the Unity3D www class, 
several built in libraries designed to talk to Unity through Application.ExternalCall() (such an an OpenTok library),
and a management tool where instructors and admins can select components of a virtual space to quickly generate a new space.

This tool is dependent on mongoDB(http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) and nodejs (http://nodejs.org/).
Usage:

npm install
node app.js
