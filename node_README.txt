In order to get started with Node you will need to download node.
http://nodejs.org/download/

Then you need to get npm installed
go to a package directory:
this project: C:\Users\pinner\Documents\GitHub\WorldManager\node_modules\pkginfo

Then:
npm install
 npm install express
 npm install request
 npm install handlebars
 npm install mongoose
 npm install fs
 npm install mongous


Then install mongodb:
google it and follow instructions


the following is not necessary for this, just an example

Now you can run node
Example:
have expressExample.js somewhere on your computer you know how to navigate to it
in the command prompt navigate to its folder
type "node expressExample.js"

Now in a browser go to localhost:3000
It will display Hello World
